          I'm <strong>Fatzy Faruk</strong>, a passionate <span className="font-semibold">full-stack developer</span> with solid knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I love building user-friendly and scalable web apps, and I'm always eager to learn new things.

          When I'm not coding, Iâ€™m probably watching tech videos, learning backend stuff, or tweaking designs. I believe consistency and learning by doing is the key to being great at anything.
